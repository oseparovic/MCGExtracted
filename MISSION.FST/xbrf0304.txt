%fc4Here we go, team. This is the big strike. We've found the location 
of the dig for the Starleague weapons vault. The Clan forces have been 
excavating weapons of mass destruction using converted Dropship engines 
as drills. We need you to go in and take out the drills, as well as any 
facilities that are processing the weapons.%n%n
%fc4Be careful, this area is defended with everything they've got. Walking 
up the front path may not be the best idea, even if we are using all of 
our weapons. Look around for any way possible to gain recon about the 
area.%n

%fc2%fs*ENEMY ACES%n
%t9Two enemy aces are known to be defending the area in customized Turkinas. As if the 
Turkinas aren't bad enough, they've been refitted to be meaner than ever. Stay sharp.%n
