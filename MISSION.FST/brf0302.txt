%fc4After a severe Jaguar counterattack, perishable medical supplies are desperately needed at Field Hospital Delta. Unfortunately, the fastest route to the hospital is a paved road across Jaguar-controlled territory. A convoy of loaded ambulances will follow that road, but speed is critical so their crews have been ordered not to stop, regardless of any danger. Your task is to see that at least two ambulances get through the area safely.%n%n
