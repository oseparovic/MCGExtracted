%fc4One of our valuable Raven scout 'Mechs, separated during the initial combat drop, has been located. The 'Mech's powerful sensors are intact, but its pilot, Mystique, has powered it down to avoid detection by a nearby enemy cargo transfer post. We know she's somewhere near the northwest end of the island we're dropping you on.%n%n
Get one of your units near the Raven, and Mystique will power up and give you command authority. Then, protect Mystique and escort her to the extraction point immediately southeast of your drop point.%n%n
There is a large quantity of Smoke Jaguar and Bondsman mechanized forces in the area, along with some 'Mechs. Pick your fights carefully and use the terrain to give yourself every advantage possible. Remember, Mystique must live to get to the extraction point along with your forces. Good luck.%n%n
