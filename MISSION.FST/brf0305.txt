%fc4A recon unit has spotted a Clan force approaching a Bondsman base we recently captured near Affendale. This base has quickly become a key staging center for our liberation of that important city.%n%n
The officer in charge of the base has been notified, but there is currently only a token force present and yours is the only unit close enough to provide adequate support.%n%n
Protect the Base HQ building and the secondary structures, such as the sensor control and power generators, as these will assist in your defense of the base.%n%n
