%fc4What if a group of Wolf-Clan-In-Exile Ace Pilots were trapped in Jade Falcon territory.  How well would they acquit themselves when the Falcons came after them?%n%n
In this simulation you play a Jade Falcon commander who stumbles across a small group of Wolf-Clan-In-Exile Aces.  Can you take them out?%n%n
North of you somewhere is an ace Madcat pilot in an LRM-equipped Madcat J with extra armor.  There are three Ullers somewhere to the west and to the northwest is a Masakari driving ace with some Long Toms stolen from the Inner Sphere.  Finally, in the northeast quadrant are the last three aces, a Cougar and two Shadowcats.%n%n
They're all aces.  All of their 'Mechs are custom built and tweaked to within an inch of their lives.  They know you're coming.  They've prepared surprises.%n%n
Good Hunting, Commander.%n%n
