%fc4Intelligence has pinpointed the source of the attacks on base Nomad.  There are several Clan outposts in the Baitan sector which were used as a staging ground for the assaults.  Secure the Baitan sector by destroying or capturing at least two of the three %fc2Base HQ's%fc4 and then proceed to the %fc2Extraction Point%fc4.  Tactical advises that a frontal assault on the outposts may be very costly due to heavy Turret protection.%n%n
Recon reports an unusual amount of security around certain structures, specifically two Clan %fc2Component Vaults%fc4.  Your secondary objective is to capture these two %fc2Component Vaults%fc4.%n%n

%fc6%c**TACTICAL NOTICE**%n%n
%fc6*%fc2 Cliffs and other rough terrain indicate that jump-capable 'Mechs may be valuable.%n%n

%fc6*%fc2 Recon reports the presence of %fc6Heavy Turret Control Towers%fc2.  These towers operate identically to normal Turret Control Towers but possess superior armor fortifications.%n%n
%fc6* Repair Bays%fc2 may be present inside the outposts.  They repair internal structure, armor, crippled legs, as well as replenish ammo for all weapons.  Repair Bays cannot repair destroyed weapons.%n%n
%fc6*%fc2 Recon reports numbers of Clan %fc6Shadow Cats%fc2.  These medium OmniMechs boast superior speed and medium range energy weapons.%n%n
%fc6* Minelayers%fc2 have been spotted in the area.  Mines are undetectable until triggered and are not set off by enemy units.  Mines can be triggered from a safe distance by firing weapons or dropping artillery on the suspected terrain.%n%n
%fc6*%fc2 ENEMY ACE:  Clan Captain %fc6Katherine Furey%fc2 is known to be overseeing defense of Baitan sector.  Be advised that Enemy Aces often utilize custom configurations for their OmniMechs.%n%n
