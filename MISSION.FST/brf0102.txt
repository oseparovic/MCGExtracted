%fc4Two of our MechWarrior pilots and their supplies have been captured by Clan Bondsmen. The pilots are being held temporarily in a "prison" barn somewhere in the area. The supplies are at a small field base in the southwest.%n%n
Your chosen force is to be dropped in a forest in the north. Battalion Transport is also dropping the APC needed to transport the prisoners from the prison as well.%n%n
Once on the ground, burn through the forest to reach the road. Then, head for the field base. There is an enemy HQ Vehicle reported at the field camp. Capturing the HQ Vehicle will reveal the enemy's position and the farm they are guarding.%n%n
Once you are detected, the Clan will likely send reinforcements from the north, so move fast. You have been allocated enough artillery to blow a bridge and stop any pursuit. Capture the supplies, then get to the farmstead and get those pilots out. To do that, order the APC to "capture" the barn.%n%n
Once you have captured the barn and recovered the pilots head to the extraction point, which has been marked on your tactical map%n
