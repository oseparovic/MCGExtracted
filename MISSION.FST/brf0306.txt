%fc4The culmination of phase three of our invasion is upon us. Your primary objective is to destroy the Smoke Jaguar Administration building in Affendale. It is within a heavily guarded complex on the foothills of Mount Samurai.%n%n
Battalion Intelligence believes that taking control of the local Clan sensor grid would be invaluable in planning your assault on the Administration Building. The Sensor Control building is within a double-walled complex near the center of Affendale.%n%n
Once the Administration building has been destroyed and its defenders dealt with make a statement by proceeding to the top of Mount Samurai, a local landmark, for extraction.%n%n
