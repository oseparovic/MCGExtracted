%fc4Based on information recovered from the DEST operative we've learned that the Jaguars are using the local industrial base to manufacture spare parts and fuels. Since we must maintain the local industrial base to help the planet rebuild after the invasion, Battalion has instead decided to destroy the two power generators along the Ai-Ki River that power the area.%n%n
Intelligence has also heard rumors of Smoke Jaguar supply caches in the area. Verify their existence and capture if possible.%n%n
