%fc4By assisting us with our landing and reconnaissance, a Port Arthur resistance cell has revealed itself to the Smoke Jaguars.%n%n
The brave men and women of the cell are currently hiding out on two farms in the Vanderhome region. Unfortunately, the Jaguars have discovered their location and have dispatched a number of small strike forces to that area. Your mission is to stop the Jaguars and protect both farms.%n%n
Given the thick forest in the area, Tactical believes a minelayer could prove valuable in booby-trapping the limited paths through the trees. Battalion Transport is also able to provide an additional forward drop zone usable as a scouting point. Use it only if you believe necessary.%n%n
Your 'Mech forces will be extracted upon completion of the mission.%n
