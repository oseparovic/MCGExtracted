%fc4The Smoke Jaguars have been putting dissident members of the population into work and re-education camps. Zulu Company has been tasked with the liberation of two such camps, designated "Alpha" and "Beta".%n%n
At "Alpha", destroy the Camp HQ building and the Natural Gas Tower, but do so carefully as the gas tower is highly volatile and will explode.%n%n
At "Beta", eliminate any guarding combat units and destroy the Camp HQ building.%n%n
Additionally, the local bondsman forces must be dealt with. Destroying the three Garrison Buildings of their base camp will help to insure our control of the area.%n%n
Battalion Transport is only able to carry three `Mechs to the engagement area, so analyze the tactical map and plan accordingly. Use the terrain available to get a better view of the enemy and potential targets.%n%n
