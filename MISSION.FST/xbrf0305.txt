%fc4Your successful assault upon the Jaguar Complex has us in prime position to strike into the Jaguar Main Command.  Strategic also reports that the Star Colonel%n
%fc2Marcus Kotare%fc4 himself is overseeing the drilling into the weapon vaults for Star League nuclear weapons.  Take your forces against the Jaguars and destroy all four drill groups.  If you fail, Kotare will have enough nuclear ordnance to turn planets into lifeless husks.%n%n
%fc4Recon reports that the drills have been set up in four different groups, unfortunately we have been able to pinpoint only three of the groups.  All four groups of drills must be destroyed to ensure that Kotare and his Jaguars have none of these weapons.%n%n
