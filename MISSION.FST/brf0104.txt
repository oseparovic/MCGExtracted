%fc4Intelligence has requested a strike against the Clan Headquarters building in Clairesfield. Our forces have hastily erected a temporary base in preparation for a sneak attack upon the small stronghold. Your team must eliminate the guarding forces, destroy the building, and then withdraw for extraction.%n%n
The enemy base will most certainly have scouting patrols guarding the obvious access routes. Stop them from returning and warning the base or it will be prepared for your assault. Destroying enemy patrols will also give you enough time to recon the base from higher elevations. Intelligence reports only one Power Generator. Destroying that Generator will undoubtedly cripple the base's perimeter defenses, which includes automated turrets and Turret Control Towers.%n%n
Once you have destroyed the Headquarters building, return to the temporary base for extraction. Since there are active enemy patrols we recommend that you divide your force and send one force to attack the enemy base while holding some units behind to guard the Support Building.%n%n
