%fc4Intelligence has confirmed that Bondsman Major Piotrev's command unit was heavily damaged in battle with our forces and is on its way to a repair base in the enemy's rear area. Your mission is to preemptively take that base and provide a warm welcome for Piotrev upon his arrival.%n%n
The base is heavily defended by turrets, but there is a weak point in the Jaguar's defense. Primary power for the base is maintained by a series of geothermal generators to the east. Taking these out will deactivate the base turrets for a minute or two until secondary power comes on line.%n%n
Take out the primary power, destroy the two industrial complexes that are producing spare parts for the base, and destroy the Major's command unit.%n%n
