Star Captain Rathbun is quartered in the %fc2Clan HQ%fc4 along the east side of the base and has valuable data regarding Jaguar troop movements.  Capture the HQ and get back to your %fc2Extraction Point%fc4.%n%n
%fc4While the other two commanders are not as important they could be useful.  Star Captain Dulaney is sitting in the %fc2Star League Command Center%fc4 on the west side of the base and that Star Captain Kulin is preparing to leave in the %fc2Hover Limo%fc4 he took to the base.%n%n
