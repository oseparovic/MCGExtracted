%fc4Star Captain %fc2Marcus Osis%fc4 of the Smoke Jaguars has executed a surprise raid on our main supply depot. He and his forces are fleeing north through Jade sector with a large number of advanced weapon components.%n%n
Our scouts have been through most of that area so a majority of your tactical map will be revealed. However, none of the buildings in Jade sector have been captured as of yet.%n%n
Your strikeforce will be dropped into Jade sector only minutes ahead of the enemy convoy. Capture as many of the%n%fc2Salvage Rigs%fc4 as possible before they escape through the forest road in the northwest.%n%n
