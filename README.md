MCGExtracted
============

Extracted contents of proprietary Mechcommander Gold archive files. Tools used to perform the extractions can be found on [Cmusta's website](http://therealcmunsta.webs.com/downloads.htm).

Purpose
-------
There has been a recent spur of MCG related modding & toold building activity. As such I wanted to help anyone with renewed interest in modding/tweaking MCG by making the extracted contents of the source files readily available. If you're interested in reading more about the latest activity check out [thegameengine](http://thegameengine.org/) or [No Gut No Galaxy](http://www.nogutsnogalaxy.net/).

Help needed!
------------
There are many source files and currently CMunsta's tools are unable to extract source files with names and file types attached. I'll need help naming files and determining file types of certain files.
